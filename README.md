It is a project I have submitted for Code First Girls. There were a few requirements to pass this course and all of them are in my code. 
Mentioned requirements are:
- Create relational  DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables,
- Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables,
- Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way,
- In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB,
- Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis,
- Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown,
- In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs,
- In your database, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs,
